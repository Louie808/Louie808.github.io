summary: Scratch Game from 8th grade.
---

I programmed a 2d maze game using blocks coding for a STEM class, which was also entered for the in-class tournament placing 3rd in a class of 30. STEM teacher just assigned the class to make a game and submit.

This was a solo simple block coding project. There was many details I added like a death count, timer, and music. Simple arrow-key input was used to control the sprite. There is collision mechanics that prevent the player from going through the walls of the maze.

Player Sprite, Timer, Death count.

Most students in the class did not know how to code and this was my first time touching code. It was a really fun experience and what led me down the computer science path. It introduced me to object oriented programming, without even knowing, and game development.
