## Deep Dive

    Raw HTML and CSS Version

Prior to Software Engineering (ICS 314), I had attempted to watch a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg">HTML Full Course</a> but was hard for me to soak it all in at once. In 314, I started to wet my feet more with HTML and CSS to create a website from scratch. My first creation was the <a href="https://github.com/Louie808/browserhistory">browser history assignment</a>. I have come to understand these languages alot more in the past two weeks of learning UI design. This enabled me to be able to understand the source code behind a website, looking through all the div containers and elements.

## Semantic Swim
<div style="padding-top: 2em; width: 500px" class="ui floated rounded right image">
  <div style="position-y: 1em" class="ui medium green right ribbon label">
    Semantic UI Version
  </div>

</div>

The introduction of semantic was a confusing and a trouble-some first experience. Rewriting the browser history page with semantic was not hard, but there was increased difficulty when recreating a website with more div containers. In the two images I provided using semantic ui to wrap with a ribbon label, is a raw html and css version and a semantic ui version.

The most distinct differences is that in the Semantic UI, there is a navigation bar menu at the top with making it much easier to click. Next is the containers for the three columns is equally same width and flows more easily when resizing the window.
