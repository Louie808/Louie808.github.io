## Deep Dive
Prior to Software Engineering (ICS 314), I had attempted to watch a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg">HTML Full Course</a> but was hard for me to soak it all in at once. In 314, I started to wet my feet more with HTML and CSS to create a website from scratch. My first creation was the <a href="https://github.com/Louie808/browserhistory">browser history assignment</a>. I have come to understand these languages alot more in the past two weeks of learning UI design. This enabled me to be able to understand the source code behind a website, looking through all the div containers and elements.
