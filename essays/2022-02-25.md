## First Thoughts
At first I thought <a href="https://radgrad2.ics.hawaii.edu/#/">RadGrad</a> was similar to STAR GPS, where it will keep track and organize just your computer science class schedule. I was wrong, and instead has shown what I can do to improve my undergraduate degree experience. I learned that it may help improve degree planning and provide useful guidance to students in finding an appropiate undergraduate degree experience based on their specific interests and career goals.

The path I have been walking along was hazy and do not know where it will lead to. With RadGrad it helps clear up the haze, making the next destination a little bit more clearer. Having no innovation or experiences, RadGrad introduced to me many opportunities, interests, and courses to open a path. Once I have found interests, possible careers, and opportunities I was able to place the possible stones I would need to reach the first destination.
