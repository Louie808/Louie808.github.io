While programming, when programmers run into problems with their code or hardware, they instinctively go to the internet to ask questions and find solutions. Sometimes the problems have solutions available online, other times there isn't any. Then you could ask a question on open forums for example <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverFlow</a> where there are many users that may have experienced or know a solution to the problem. However, some questions asked may be labeled a "bad question" because there are several elements to consider before posting the question.

## Question Guidelines
In the article "<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>," written by Eric Steven Raymond, teaches you how to ask questions in such a manner that you are more likely to receive a satisfactory response. Raymond's guideline and standard is divided into two sections, before and when asking.

Before asking a question, you should try looking for your answer reading through the web, the manual, a FAQ, archives of the forum. You could also do inspection or experimentation on your program, asking a skilled friend for help, or looking in the source code. When you ask your question, displaying the fact that you have done these things first, shows an aptitude for learning from the responses.

When asking a question, Raymond's guidelines also has DONT'S that should be considered when asking a question. Forum posts should be related to the topic, very elementary question to a forum where advanced qechincal questions are expected or vice versa, cross-post to many different newsgroups, or send a personal email to someone who is not responsible for answering your question. Your questions should use specific meaningful titles, being concise, straightforward, abd clear of unnecessary information. Descriptions of the problem and the problem's symptoms and the goal is helpful for people who are going to answer your question. 

## Smart Question
This post is a good <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/336859/var-functionname-function-vs-function-functionname">post</a> from a user that asked a smart question. The title addresses what they are confused about, asking for the difference between two function syntaxes for javascript. Many experts and developers, who answered, all provided very informative responses for the differences and uses for the two function syntaxes.

## Not Smart Question
This post is a bad <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39564143/sum-of-squares-homework">post</a> from a user that asked a not so smart question. The title isn't descriptive enough and does not show what problem they are hoping to solve. Some experts and developers were stuck because they didn't want to go through the hassle of running the code, and suggested that the poster should provide input and outputs. The question ended up being closed because it was not a smart question and follow guidelines.
