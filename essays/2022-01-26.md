While programming, when programmers run into problems with their code or hardware, they instinctively go to the internet to ask questions and find solutions. Sometimes the problems have solutions available online, other times there isn't any. Then you could ask a question on open forums for example <a> href"https://stackoverflow.com/"StackOverFlow</a> where there are many users that may have experienced or know a solution to the problem. However, some questions asked may be labeled a "bad question" because there are several elements to consider before posting the question.

## Question Guidelines
In the article "<a> href"http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"How to Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>," written by Eric Steven Raymond, teaches you how to ask questions in such a manner that you are more likely to receive a satisfactory response. Raymond's guidline is divided into two sections, before and whhen asking.

### "Before You Ask"
```
1. Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list
   you plan to post to.

2. Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

3. Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

4. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.

5. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

6. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

7. If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.
```

### "When You Ask"

``` 
- Do not post your question to a forum where it's off topic

- Do not post a very elementary question to a forum where advanced technical
   questions are expected, or vice-versa
   
- Do not cross-post to too many different newsgroups

- Do not post a personal e-mail to somebody who is neither an acquaintance of
   yours nor personally responsible for solving your problem
```
