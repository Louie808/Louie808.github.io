While programming, when programmers run into problems with their code or hardware, they instinctively go to the internet to ask questions and find solutions. Sometimes the problems have solutions available online, other times there isn't any. Then you could ask a question on open forums for example <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverFlow</a> where there are many users that may have experienced or know a solution to the problem. However, some questions asked may be labeled a "bad question" because there are several elements to consider before posting the question.

## Question Guidelines
In the article "<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>," written by Eric Steven Raymond, teaches you how to ask questions in such a manner that you are more likely to receive a satisfactory response. Raymond's guideline and standard is divided into two sections, before and when asking.

Before asking a question, you should try looking for your answer reading through the web, the manual, a FAQ, archives of the forum. You could also do inspection or experimentation on your program, asking a skilled friend for help, or looking in the source code.

When asking a question, Raymond's guidelines also has DONT'S that should be considered when asking a question. Forum posts should be related to the topic, very elementary question to a forum where advanced qechincal questions are expected or vice versa, cross-post to many different newsgroups, or send a personal email to someone who is not responsible for answering your question. Your questions should use specific meaningful titles, being concise, straightforward, abd clear of unnecessary information. Descriptions of the problem and the problem's symptoms and the goal is helpful for people who are going to answer your question.
