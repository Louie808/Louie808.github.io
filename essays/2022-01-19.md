## What is this?
My first encounter to coding was for an 8th grade assignment in a STEM class. The STEM teacher assigned the class to make a game using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. Scratch is a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital tales, games, and animations. It is the world's largest coding community for children. This site was a sprite lab which is a block-based programming environment and you can easily publish your project to the community.

Most of the class had no prior knowledge and a lot of our games were basic and simple. After exploring the site and playing other user's games, I enjoyed the platform games and took inspiration for my game. Although I wasn't able to recreate the physics and get the collisions to work, I instead made a simple <a href="https://louie808.github.io/projects/scratchGame"> maze game</a>.

## Sleeper
After experiencing making my own game, I wanted to learn more about coding and programming. In my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/HeatWaveStar/">Scratch</a> account, I used the site a few more times for random high school classes. During highschool, the ICS academy classes were not as good and did not learn anything new for programming. When I attended college and took ICS 111, I enjoyed learning Java and quickly absorbed the language. At the end of the course, I  had fun programming my own <a href="https://louie808.github.io/projects/blackJack_GUI">Black Jack GUI</a>.

## Upcoming
In the future, I would like to learn more lanugages and improve my proficiency in the ones I now know. To acquire a sense of various work settings, I would like to work on different software engineering teams.
