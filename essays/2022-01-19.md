## What is this?
My first encounter to coding was for an 8th grade assignment in a STEM class. The STEM teacher assigned the class to make a game using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. Scratch is a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital tales, games, and animations. It is the world's largest coding community for children. This site was a sprite lab which is a block-based programming environment and you can easily publish your project to the community.

Most of the class had no prior knowledge and a lot of our games were basic and simple. After exploring the site and playing other user's games, I enjoyed the platform games and took inspiration for my game. Although I wasn't able to recreate the physics and get the collisions to work, I instead made a simple <a href="https://louie808.github.io/projects/scratchGame"> maze game</a> (My <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/HeatWaveStar/">Scratch</a> account).
