## What is this?
My first encounter to coding was for an 8th grade assignment in a STEM class. The STEM teacher assigned the class to make a game using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. Scratch is a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital tales, games, and animations. It is the world's largest coding community for children. This site was a sprite lab which is a block-based programming environment and you can easily publish your project to the community.

Most of the class had no prior knowledge and a lot of our games were basic and simple. After exploring the site and playing other user's games, I enjoyed the platform games and took inspiration for my game. Although I wasn't able to recreate the physics and get the collisions to work, I instead made a simple <a href="https://louie808.github.io/projects/scratchGame"> maze game</a>.

## After Scratch
After experiencing making my own game, I wanted to learn more about coding and programming. In my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/HeatWaveStar/">Scratch</a> account, I used the site a few more times for random high school classes. During highschool, the ICS academy classes were not beneficial and did not learn anything for programming. When I started college and took ICS 111, I really enjoyed learning Java and quickly absorbed the language. At the end of the course, I had fun programming my own <a href="https://louie808.github.io/projects/blackJack_GUI">Black Jack GUI</a>. The courses afterwards took me deeper into coding teaching new lanuguages, data structures, algorithms, and many other skills.

## Upcoming
In the future, I would like to learn more lanugages and improve my proficiency in the ones I now know. I hope to acquire the knowledge to be able to develop software and application programming interface(API). I want to make many connections with many others and hope to work with them in future projects. To acquire a sense of various work settings, I would like to be employed on different software engineering teams and acquire even more mastery of computer science.
