## What is the reusable solution?
Design Pattern is a generic repeatable solution to a typically occurring problem in software design in software engineering. 
It is a template for solving an issue that may be applied to a variety of scenarios. 
In many video games I play, a design pattern is utilized in the development and building of the app.

## Design Patterns in Genshin Impact 
In a game I play, called Genshin Impact, to make your characters stronger is by leveling their level, talents, and artifacts. 
The most intricate part of Genshin character building is the artifacts stats and artifact sets that can be given to each character.
Each artifact stat, artifact substats, character level, and character talent level will affect the damage output of your character.


The simplest formula for calculating damage, ignoring character buffs and critical hits, is: 
```
ATK = Attack    DMG = Damage    RES = Resistance    DEF = Defense
Non-critical Hit = ATK Power * Skill% * Enemy Damage Reduction * DMG Bonus% * (1 - RES%)
ATK Power = [(Character's Base ATK + Weapon ATK) * (1 + Weapon ATK% bonuses + Artifact ATK% bonuses)] + Artifact ATK flat bonuses]
Enemy Damage Reduction = (Character Level + 100) / [(1 - DEF Reduction Debuffs%) * (Enemey Level + 100) + (Character Level + 100)]
```

The character building represents many design patterns of
