<h2> Crashing into Javascript </h2>

The crash course helped introduce Javascript syntaxes, from past Java and C++ coding knowledge. It helped me picture and identify the new attributes and changes from my previous knowledge. The first 70% was easy enough that it only took less than a few minutes to complete, but past that threshold, it took a lot more time to comprehend the material. I had the hardest time learning about the objects and how Javascript allows you to store different data types into the same variable. Recursion was the 2nd hardest to relearn and wrap my head around.

An example to being allowed to store different data types in a variable. 
```java
int allowed[] = {0,1,2,3}; // allowed
int not-allowed[] = {"not", function(), 23}; // not allowed
```
```javascript
const allowed = [1,2,3]; // allowed
let alsoAllowed = ['not', function(), 23]; //allowed
```

<h2> Upgrading to ECMAScript </h2>
For the ES6 part of the course, I spent a more time on each section of the course to comprehend the new features for Javascript. I often got stuck in the last 30% of 1st course and entirety of ES6 course. This is because there were often questions where it was hard to identify what was being asked for. So I would often look at the hints provided, and search up YouTube videos to understand the new features.

<h2> Running the Brain </h2>
Putting what we learned into practice, "Workout of the Day(WOD)" allows us to workout a coding problem. It also applies pressure and stress by being ranked on the time it takes to solve the problem, simulating software engineering problems during job interviews. When I first attempted the WOD I finished in a decent amount of time. As I attempted the WODs more and more I was making myself more comfortable with Javascript. I really like this style of learning and would benefit me as a software engineer and coding interviews.
