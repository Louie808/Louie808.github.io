The crash course helped introduce introduce and freshen Javascript syntaxes, from past Java and C++ coding knowledge. It helped me depict and identify the new attributes and changes from my previous knowledge. The first 70 % were easy that it only took a few minutes to complete, but past that threshold took alot more time to comprehend the material. Objects I had the hardest time understanding and learning, 2nd being recursion.
