## Learning Coding Style
Looking back to when I first started to code, using block coding, the organization of the code is very unclean and messy. In my codes for ICS 111, the code was organized a little better, but there are many style errors that can be fixed to make it nicer and easier read. Being introduced to commenting in ICS 111 and "<a href="http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics211s21/morea/010.introduction/reading-java-coding-standard.html">ICS Java Coding Standed</a>" in ICS 211 helped explain, organize, and write cleaner codes. In ICS 212, we utilizedd Vim, text editor with very primal editintg, on unix. The class had strict coding style to follow, but it was very beneficial, allowing us to be more consistent and cleaner with coding files.

## ELIint First Impressions
When ESLint is enabled and I first begin to write the code file, many red lines appear. I find it very annoying to have to see those lines at the beginning because it distracts me and I want to fix it right away. It is bad practice, but I would end up turning on the ESLint until after solving the assignment problem to update code to meet the coding standards.
Other than that, I find using ESLint very useful helping me catch writing style errors and fixing it up.
